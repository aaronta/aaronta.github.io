## Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)

Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive quantitative imaging technique that measures the viscoelastic tissue stiffness. Development of MRE at the Beckman Institue focuses on characterizing tissue across healthy populations and from changes due to neurodegenerative diseases. At Carle Foundation Hospital, MRE is being applied to clinical populations where it may be able to improve diagnosis towards improved patient outcomes.
