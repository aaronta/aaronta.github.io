### In the news

During my tenure as a teaching assistant during 2013, I helped with an initiative ([SIIP][siip]) to update some of the introductory engineering courses.  Since my TA appointment was with [TAM 212: Introductory Dynamics][tam212], I helped to test new ideas, report back to faculty about the implementation, and help improve the content. [I-STEM][istem] held a symposium on campus to highlight initiatives aiming to improve STEM education. One of the MechSE faculty members gave a talk and we presented a poster.   It was great to get our story out to other faculty and students, and we learned a lot about what others are doing.
